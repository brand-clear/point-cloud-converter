# PointCloudTransformer
An application that converts noisy point cloud data into an excel document that can be imported into Autodesk Inventor. 

## Purpose
In the reverse engineering of mechanical systems, geometrical data is often captured as a point cloud using laser scanning technology. Creating 3D models from point cloud data can be laborious when the data cannot easily be uploaded into the modeling software. This application serves as middleware between PolyWorks Inspector, which exports data in TXT format, and Autodesk Inventor, which accepts data in XLSX format.
